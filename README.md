#  Music Recommendation System
This repository contains the code for building a fully functional music recommendation system using TensorFlow.

## Key Insights
- Leveraged the big data Last.fm music dataset to build a deep learning music recommendation system on 1892 users, 17632 artists, and 92834 user-artist relationships
- Provided quality music recommendations to users using collaborative filtering
- Discovered that artist popularity had the strongest influence on recommendations
- Developed three music recommenders:
    1. A basic model using tensor flow variables. 
    2. A regularized model by applying a gravity function
    3. A softmax model.
- Enabled users to generate their recommendations by adding preferences to the model
- Softmax produced the highest quality recommendations
- Learned a lot about the TensorFlow library during this project
